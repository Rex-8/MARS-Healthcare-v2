# Health Management Database Design

## Entities and Relationships

1. Patient
   - Attributes: ID, Name, DateOfBirth, ContactInfo
   - Relationships:
     * Many-to-Many with Doctor
     * One-to-Many with Treatment
     * Many-to-Many with Medication (for current medications)

2. Doctor
   - Attributes: ID, Name, Specialization, ContactInfo
   - Relationships:
     * Many-to-Many with Patient
     * One-to-Many with Treatment

3. Treatment
   - Attributes: ID, StartDate, EndDate, Status (Ongoing/Completed)
   - Relationships:
     * Many-to-One with Patient
     * Many-to-One with Doctor
     * One-to-Many with Visit
     * Many-to-One with Disease

4. Visit
   - Attributes: ID, Date, Notes
   - Relationships:
     * Many-to-One with Treatment
     * Many-to-Many with Medication (prescribed during this visit)

5. Disease
   - Attributes: ID, Name, Description
   - Relationships:
     * One-to-Many with Treatment
     * Many-to-Many with Medication
     * Many-to-Many with Surgery
     * Many-to-Many with Vaccine

6. Medication
   - Attributes: ID, Name, Description
   - Relationships:
     * Many-to-Many with Disease
     * Many-to-Many with Patient (for current medications)
     * Many-to-Many with Visit (for prescriptions)

7. Surgery
   - Attributes: ID, Name, Description
   - Relationships:
     * Many-to-Many with Disease

8. Vaccine
   - Attributes: ID, Name, Description
   - Relationships:
     * Many-to-Many with Disease

9. Allergy
   - Attributes: ID, Name, Description
   - Relationships:
     * Many-to-Many with Patient

## Key Considerations

1. Patient Profile:
   - Show all treatments (ongoing and completed)
   - Display current medications

2. Doctor Profile:
   - List all treatments the doctor is handling
   - Ability to view details of each treatment, including visits and summary

3. Data Dating:
   - Treatments have StartDate and EndDate
   - Visits have Date

4. Minimal Display:
   - When pulling up data for Disease, Medication, Surgery, Vaccine, and Allergy, only show Name and Description

5. Inter-entity Relationships:
   - Disease is linked to related Medications, Surgeries, and Vaccines
   - Medication is linked to associated Diseases

## Additional Notes

- The Patient-Medication many-to-many relationship represents current medications.
- The Visit-Medication many-to-many relationship represents prescriptions given during a visit.
- Treatment status (Ongoing/Completed) allows easy filtering of current and past treatments.
- The Disease entity acts as a central point connecting Treatments, Medications, Surgeries, and Vaccines.

This design allows for:
- Viewing a patient's current and past treatments
- Seeing a patient's current medications
- Viewing all treatments a doctor is handling
- Accessing detailed treatment information, including all visits
- Relating diseases to medications, surgeries, and vaccines
- Viewing medications associated with a disease and vice versa
